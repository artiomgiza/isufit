# isufit
Automatic filling isufit

1. Copy js from `fill.js` file
2. Open Isufit
3. Right click on one of the lines --> `inspect` (IMPORTANT!!!)
4. console tab --> paste --> enter

===> but exist <===

Will be fixed, but for now the script only insert in/out times. 
So need click on each cell and press enter.
Yes, it's bad, but still better than also insert all the times :)
